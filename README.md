### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
I have learned to make an element looks good on all screens and appearing in center of the screen. 
like the section element

```html
<section class="orderSummaryData">.....</section>

```
```css
.orderSummaryCard {
  min-width: 300px;
  width: 50%;
  max-width: 410px;
  }
```


### Continued development

I will focus on responsive design more than now and improve the website performance.
